**SYNOPSIS**

Using a Telegram Bot's Chat to Act as a Command and Control Platform.

Telegram Bots are able to both receive AND send messages. so can you use it as a C2? ....Enter a proof of concept :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**INFORMATION**

This script will wait until it is called in chat by the computer name to take commands from telegram.

A list of Modules can be accessed by typing 'options' in chat, or you can use the chat to act simply as a reverse shell.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FEATURES**

Session Queue          - While running, this script waits for a start phrase (the computer name) before connecting, allowing multiple computers to wait for interaction.

Botnet Mode            - Add simultaneous sessions to control multiple computers at once. (enter computer names one after the other into chat)

Persistance            - Can add itself to startup folder (RemovePersistance command will undo this)

Options List           - Once connected type "Options" to see a list of operations. ("ExtraInfo" will show more command info)

Pause Session          - exits the current session and script waits for re-authrentication.

Key Capture Standby    - only sends messages if keys are pressed and remains idle otherwise.

File Size Intellegence - Auto split Uploads over 50mb.

Privilege Escalation   - The ability to send the user a UAC prompt for this script and restart if succesful.

Toggle Error Messaging - Turn On or Off returning error messages to the chat. (Off by default)

Reverse shell          - apart from running the modules, once connected the chat can act as a reverse shell.

Killswitch             - Any Modules such as "KeyCapture" and "Exfiltrate" can be killed by typing "KILL" into chat
                         (this returns the session so it can accept further commands (does not kill the connection.))
